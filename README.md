# Real Estate APP
This is a very practical website where we take a list of requirements to build a real estate application using Django. We will take a basic html/css Bootstrap 4 theme and turn it into a real working application with an admin area to manage resources including property listings, realtors and contact inquiries. 


To successfully run this Project, you will need to use a Virtual Environment. After installing and activating a virtual Environment, Install :
Django==2.2.13
Pillow==6.2.0
psycopg2==2.7.5
psycopg2-binary==2.7.5
pytz==2018.5

Please Note, The PostgresDB is empty and you can create and Modify the DB to you own personal Settings in the btre/settings.py file.

Also the mailing app wont work untill you fill in the mail client and settings in the last part of the btre/settings.py file.
